Even being a fan of "main character transported to

like the first book (Ready Player One).</p><p>I didn't think it would be possible to cram more 80s references than the first
book, but Ready Player Two did. It's a non-stop vomit. This new book introduces
the concept of "Needlepoints." These are locations in the OASIS that trigger
background music. Every page has at least 2-3 song references played at these
points.</p><p>Following the tradition, the new book also has a series of quests. The quests
are very simple. Most of them are hand$$waved with "I have already done a series
of activities on this planet and have this thingamajig that solves it." At least
3 of them where unnecessary.</p><h2 id=dispatcher01>John Scalzi - The Dispatcher 01 - The Dispatcher - 4/5

horror stories, ranging from "ancient Gods waking up" to "mind-controlling

extrapolate how the aliens looked like and lived." Some were more adventurous
and followed the footsteps of extinct civilizations.</p><p>The only reason it got 4/5: The story by Orson Scott Card really felt out of
place in this anthology. It really didn't have anything to do with ancient
aliens remains or artifacts. I think they just wanted to include a story by a
famous writer.</p><h2 id=stardestroyers>Christopher Ruocchio & Tony Daniel - Star Destroyers (Anthology) - 3.5/5

distaste for government. Williamson is a libertarian and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_%28novel%29 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Freehold</a>
was a libertarian utopia. I loved it and appreciated his worldview of "small
folks against big government." I didn't question how the big bad sluggish and
incompetent UN became so powerful. I guess this was before I realized I am more
of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Reynolds target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Mack Reynolds</a> type of "big gov hater."</p><p>Most people's problem with this book are the very detailed and graphic sex
scenes. It's a series of soft porn scenes interlaced with Sci-Fi. I also think
they were unnecessary, but hey, "sex sells."</p><p>I am not sure what has happened to the author since the original Freehold book
because he has turned into the online libertarian warrior caricature and a
walking Facebook meme page complaining about the new generation.</p><p>I laughed out loud halfway through the book when in the middle of the
interrogation, the torturer said "my preferred pronouns are xir." I didn't
expect a "pronouns in bio" moment and the main character ranting about trans
people. You wanna make a torturer trans, I have no problem with that, but "xir
is a torturer because xir is trans" was hilarious.</p><p>There were discussions about how minimum wage, employee benefits (Freehold
businesses went bankrupt because they had to provide benefits, lol), work hour
regulations (the torturers couldn't work more than 10 hours, lol), government
mandated contracts and even warnings on tools/appliances. What makes this more
hilarious is the author served 25 years in the US military which has all of
this and more. It's the biggest socialist jobs program in the country.</p><h2 id=saga02>Kevin Anderson - Saga of the Seven Suns 02 - Forest of Stars - 5/5

middle of a built universe without much explanation. Some of the concepts of the
book are explained through the book, but some questions are never answered.
Like, who are even the Harvesters?</p><p>There's a lot of text about character backgrounds and their relationships with
the original inhabitants of the system. These are never fully explored because
they're the subject of previous books in the series.</p><p>Other than that, the action is fluid and I liked the how book jumped between

The billion worlds refer to
the almost innumerable habitats, terraformed planets/moons, and modified
asteroids in the solar system (and a few nearby stars) housing trillions of
biological and digital beings. There are genetically modified humans, dolphins,
Martians, and other species mixed with AIs of different intelligence levels.</p><p>The universe offers digital existence, genetic modification, matter printers
(e.g., create almost any matter like food or clothes). Travel is still bound by
physical laws so going around the solar system is slow (and requires
hibernation). There are a few nearby stars that are populated (there's a mention
of ships at half the speed of light).</p><p>The story follows a group of characters (mainly a "robot AI" and a human) in

countless species of aliens. I give the world building 6/5 and main character
development 3/5. The extensive world building makes sense when I realized he is
a fantasy tabletop game designer.</p><p>I especially liked how the author had devised a sort of distinctive grammar and
sentence structure in English for the each species' usage of the planet's
"common tongue" language. My favorite is the Itooti's usage of adjectives based
on the tone of the conversation. E.g., "Curious [Name] wants to know why flimsy
looking aliens [referring to humans] are in civilized [city name]."</p><p>Some cons: 2 of the 4 main humans are stock characters and they did not have a
lot of development. A couple of loose ends are not tied.</p><h2 id=kaiju>John Scalzi - The Kaiju Preservation Society - 3/5

be about quartering soldiers in homes or the 3rd amendment because that's how
the other two were, lol.</p><p>I am not sure <strong>WHY</strong> I actually read these two chapters. I mean I expect
military science fiction is to be full of conservatives, but this sort of
nonsense was just too much. It didn't even have to do much with the rest of the
book. It looked like the authors wanted to rant. The book got better, but when it
has hit rock bottom, the only way is up.</p><h2 id=swordant>David G. Hartwell & Jacob Weisman - The Sword & Sorcery Anthology - 4/5

<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Drake target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">David Drake</a> which is basically "the old British navy in space."
I liked the book and the setting because I am a fan of RCN (and David Drake).
The author has published a sequel, <a href=https://www.baen.com/the-silent-hand.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">The Silent Hand</a>.
<del>I will update the booklist and this title when the series gets a name.</del> Seems
like the series names is <del>"Myriad Worlds"</del> "The Deep Man Trilogy" (according
to "The" Silent "Hand" book).</p><p>The setting is an honor-bound society (people duel when their "honor is taken")
ruled by an emperor. There are of course big families juggling for influence.
There are two types of citizens, demi-cits who are provided by the state and
vested citizens who can do what they want. There are ways to become a vested
citizen, but you face an uphill battle because influential families have the
backing of centuries and influence. There's an example of a new vested citizen
almost losing his life. Every military person is a vested citizen.
Officers can purchase their commissions (kinda). There are aliens (Shapers) who
visit every decade and exchange resources for tech. Ship-to-ship action is
mostly close range.</p><p>Saef, the main character is a male vested citizen from an old but poor
traditional family. Very similar to Daniel Leary in RCN who comes from a famous
family but is poor because he's estranged from his rich and famous father.</p><p>Inga Maru is a copy of Adele Mundy from RCN. The loyal but badass female
companion with exceptional abilities. The author has a short story named <code>Flops</code>
that deal with Inga's background. You can read it for free in

I picked up the book because I had
recently enjoyed several anthologies edited by the author. I powered through the
first part of the book, loved the second, and got bored and skimmed the last
parts.</p><p>The setting is interesting and reminded me of Europe during the crusades. It's
yet another feudalism in space, space opera. Religious organization with an
inquisition branch (with its own weapons) that limits what technology is
available to the masses. An emperor that rules through hereditary feudal lords
living in luxury with manipulated genes to live for half a century. Serfs
generally live in poverty. Slavery is legal.</p><p>Faster than light travel is possible, but travel time is still measured in years
between systems so people go into stasis. And of course, a war with an alien
enemy that has been going on for a few hundred years. Allegedly, the settings
was pulled from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Book of the New Sun</a> (people refer to the beginning
paragraphs which are tbh very similar among other things).</p><p>The author is wordy (maybe because he's an editor?). Almost every other page has
a quote from a real or fictional writer/philosopher. There are a lot of things
that could have been skipped.</p><p>My biggest gripe with the book is that same events keep repeating. Does the
author think the readers are stupid and need half a dozen examples of sibling
rivalry and "my parents don't love me" (in the first part) to get the picture?
Or how many scenes of "the chantry are evil" in the last part? Come on :).</p><p>Mild spoilers ahead. The book can be divided into four parts:</p><ul><li>Main character is still on his home planet. Bad father, absent mother, violent
sibling. I did not like this part and powered through it.</li><li>Moves to a 2nd planet and survives in the streets and the arena. I loved this
part and couldn't put it down.</li><li>His identity is discovered and he moves to the palace. Love triangle. Not great.</li><li>Encounter with the aliens. Chantry messes it up. I just skimmed through this
just to finish the book.</li></ul><p>The ending was anti-climactic. I am still going to give the 2nd book a try
(public libraries FTW) and see if it picks up speed. Looks like it's as big as
the first.</p><h2 id=newsun01>Gene Wolf - Book of the New Sun 01 - The Shadow of the Torturer 3/5

book. OK, I get it, you wanna put all those religious fables and Latin words in
the book. What are all these D&amp;D-like "random encounters" that do not add
anything to the story (e.g., the gardens)?</p><p>I liked the setting. The sun is dying. It's feudal Europe with some existing
advanced technology from the past like portals, flyers, and robots. No one knows
how these things work anymore.</p><p>Anyways, I just finished the book and moved to the 2nd.</p><h2 id=newsun02>Gene Wolf - Book of the New Sun 02 - The Claw of the Conciliator 4.5/5

This is much better. The pace is faster and the
author actually figured out what they want to do with the main character.</p><p>My only issue with the book is the missing gap between the books. At the end of
book one, the main character is with his group. At the beginning of the second
book all of them are gone except one. I thought some pages had been removed from
the "Shadow & Claw" edition of the book that I was reading (combines the first
two books), but no. There are some cryptic explanations of the events through
the book, and I was expecting some extraordinary event, but it was very mundane.</p><p>But I like the writing style of this book better. The inclusion of stories and
the play reminds me of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal%C4%ABla_wa-Dimna target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Kalila wa-Dimna</a> or کلیله و دمنه, one of my
favorite books in Farsi. The stories in that book are like the movie Inception
or Russian dolls. E.g., the main characters start a story and in the middle, one
says, this is like the story of X. Then the X story starts and in the middle,
one of new the characters says, this is just like Y story, and so on. The
stories go a few layers deep.</p><p>In this book, there's only one layer and they're not like "random encounters"
from the first book and actually advance the plot.</p><p>I am gonna take a break before reading the 3rd book.</p><h2 id=bookofswords>Gardner Dozois - Book of Swords (Anthology) - 4/5

Assassination attempt at court.</li><li>"The Mocking Tower": Heir to a deceased king tries to steal a sword from a
magical tower. I didn't like the story, but the changing descriptions of the
tower were exotic.</li><li>"The King's Evil": Three adventurers go to a cursed island to recover an
ancient treasure. The main character has an existential crisis (don't we
all?). I did not like the story, but the writing was excellent.</li><li>"The Sons of the Dragon": History of the two sons of an emperor set in the
"Game of Thrones" setting. Reads like a history book. It was full of action,
but meaningless to me because I have neither read the books nor watched the TV
series.</li></ul><p>I didn't like:</p><ul><li>"Her Father's Sword": Kidnapped villagers return as selfish drones. Girl
struggles to connect with the soulless husk of her father. I didn't really
like it.</li><li>"The Hidden Girl": 10 year old girl is kidnapped by assassins and trained.
Develops a consicous.<ul><li>"We're all thieves in this world of suffering," the nun says, "Honor and
faith are not virtues, only excuses for stealing more."</li></ul></li><li>"The Sword of Destiny": Wizard's apprentice is sent to steal a magic sword. Runs away instead and takes a detour.</li><li>"Hrunting": Man tries to recover his grandfather's ancient sword that was thrown away by Beowulf.</li><li>"When I was a Highway Man": Dueling youth tries to make a living in big city.
The city of Riverside sounds interesting and is part of the author's other
books. But I didn't like this story, but I am gonna try some of the other
books.</li><li>"The Sword Tyraste": Man tries to avenge his family with the help of a magic
sword. It was an easy read, but very bland.</li></ul><p>Quotes from "The Smoke of Gold is Glory"</p><ul><li>"Anyway, I am famous among my friends for having never in my life behaved with
any particular wisdom." - Tarkaster Crale, thief and storyteller.</li><li>"O King," the dragon murmured, wheezing, and with every breath spilling more
fiery ichor on the ground, "in all our ten thousand years, we have had but
four friends, and we have only met them this night."</li><li>[Glimraug the dragon]: "[...] The long-awaited wonder comes! True

It's not my cup of tea. The only
reason I am reading them is because they're small books.</p><p>The <a href=/literature/bookreviews/#murderbot01>first book</a> was better. I guess
the whole idea of the a bot that wants to be independent and wathes TV series was
fun, but the other three books quickly got boring and repetitive.</p><p>A whole lot of dialoge is dedicated to the murderbot covering its tracks. A good
20% of the books are "I hacked something, I wiped off my movements from logs,
and so on." I think we get the idea that for some reason this bot can hack
anything and everything. Stations are full of security scanners, cameras, and
bots, but they are hackable at a snap.</p><p>Another question is other bots like the transport ship bot don't have governor
modules and can do pretty much any illegal activity they want. People don't like
SecUnits (which have governor modules), but are not afraid of bots or constructs
that do not.</p><h2 id=murderbot05>Martha Wells - Murderbot Diaries 06 - Fugitive Telemetry - 3/5

series) because chronologically the story here happens after the 4th book (Exit
Strategy).</p><p>It's a whodunnit murder mystery. A murder has happened in the station and
murderbot must find the murderer and gain the loyalty of residents. I actually,
liked this book better than the rest mostly because there was not a lot of
words dedicated to "hacking" (see review above).</p><p>Better, but still not my cup of tea.</p><h2 id=icarus01>Timothy Zahn - Icarus Saga 01 - The Icarus Plot - 4/5

Space Opera with a lot of action, extensive universe without a
lot of boring world building.</p><p>There are many references and recurring characters to book 0,
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192528.The_Icarus_Hunt target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">The Icarus Hunt</a> (not sure why Goodreads has numbered it 0 instead of 1).
I suggest you read it first. I didn't and I still enjoyed the book. The
references are explained later.</p><p>Two former bounty hunters turned surveyors are tasked with surveying a planet,
but of course the plot makes them go back to doing what they're good at, finding
people. The book's universe is huge with multiple alien species. An alien race
dominate faster than light travel and an alliance of others including humands
are competing for domination through economic and cladestine warfare.</p><p>I really appreciated how the author didn't have extensive world building
chapters and instead kept the action going on. The last third of the book is a
bit repetitive especially the part were the good people outsmart the bad folks,
and the ending is somewhat cheesy. But I guess it's not space opera if the good
people don't win.</p><p>I will probably read "The Icarus Hunt" before moving to the next book in this
series.</p><h2 id=heroes01>David Drake - Time of Heroes 01 - The Spark - 5/5

I had mostly read
short stories by him in the last few years. I mostly reread
<a href=https://www.baen.com/redliners.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Redliners</a> (DRM-free digital format is free on Baen's website), or
Hammer's Slammers. For the last few years, I used to send him actual snail mail
for his birthday and he would reply to my email. This year he didn't and it
turns out he wasn't feeling that great.</p><p>I had not read them before, so I picked up the three books in the "Times of
Heroes" series from the local public library for holiday reading. I gobbled the
book in less than a day.</p><p>2023-2024 holiday reading list courtesy of the local public library:</p><p><img src=holiday2023.jpeg alt="2023 holiday reading list"></p><p>I really love the world. There's "the road" that people can use to travel
between nodes. I think it's like a long portal because it's mentioned while it
has light, you cannot see the sun there.</p><p>Nodes are (usually isolated) parcels of land where people can live and is part
of "Here." Monsters and magic items are in "Not-Here" (obviously). In between
these we have "The Waste" which humans can traverse for a bit with the help of
their animal companions with a mental link. Most main characters have one. This
mental link allows them to see through their senses. Our champion has a dog
and fights through his eyes with added agility and reaction time.</p><p>The series is an Arthurian fantasy in a far future world. Champions fight with
energy swords and shields. The ancients have left "magical" items that people
can reshape or reuse. Is it advanced technology or magic? Doesn't matter, you
know the famous quote:</p><blockquote><p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p><p>Arthur C. Clarke</p></blockquote><p>The people who can modify these magical items and reshape them are called
"Makers." They go into a trance and can see and modify the molecular structure
of an artifact to change it. This usually needs extra trace elements (e.g., Iron
or Silicon). Our champion is both a maker and a fighter. We even see some boats
with limited sentience and they can be used to travel between nodes. The boats
are self powered, look like an enclosed cigar, and are airships (I figured this
out after looking at the cover for the 3rd book.)</p><p>The story has a huge gaping hole. I am going to try and not spoil it. Pal
acquires his first kingdom and castle. In the kingdom there's an ancient
artifact that acts like an all-seeing eye. You think of anyone and it will give
you a live feed of them and their immediate surrounding. The artifact is never
used. In the last part of this book Pal nearly dies because a certain person is
missing. No one, including Pal thinks of using this artifact to locate that
person.</p><h2 id=heroes02>David Drake - Time of Heroes 02 - The Storm - 4/5

fan.</p><p>Although most series repeat some background information from previous books,
this ones has too much. Pal (the main character) keeps repeating how he was a
peasant, how he created his original crap equipment, how his current sword and
shield are great, how makers work to restore/reuse artifacts, and how the road
works.</p><p>The major plot in this book is also another missing person. Again, no one thinks
of using the all-seeing eye artifact from the previous book to look for them.
What was the reason for even including the artifact originally?</p><p>The main quest in this book is also abandoned for quite a while. Pal goes around
and does side quests while there's no progress on the main quest. I mean, this
is the typical open world RPG tabletop or videogame, but still.</p><p>It's shorter than the previous book. I borrowed the hardcover versions from the
library. The first book is 340 pages and this one is 280. The next book is
considerably shorter.</p><h2 id=heroes03>David Drake - Time of Heroes 03 - The Serpent - 3/5

The disappointment continues. The length
of the book is again, smaller. From 340 pages in the first book, to 280 in the
second, and finally 180 pages here (these are all hardcover editions I borrowed
from the public library).</p><p>Of course, the redundancy continues. Yes, Pal was born a peasant, doesn't like
the court, his past equipment was crap, his current equipment is great, he can
predict attacks with his dog, he has a boat, and so on. There was no need to
mention these multiple times during the book.</p><p>This book doesn't have a main quest or major plot. It's easier to think of this
book as a series of short stories in that setting. I guess that's why there's
excessive repeating. Each story needs to mention some of the background info.
Unfortunately, the plots of stories are kind of similar. Pal goes to some node
to solve a conflict, ends up killing the ruler (through no fault of his own,
lol) and takes over the node for the commonwealth (and reluctantly pockets half
of the taxes).</p><p>One of the stories introduced an interesting concept. A female maker.
Unfortunately, the character appears in only one story and very briefly.</p><p>Another disappointing point for me were the artifacts. So many amazing artifacts
were introduced by the end of the third book, but most of them (like the
all-seeing eye) were never used or mentioned.</p><p>There are a lot of loose ends in this book. I think Mr. Drake (whom I admire a
lot) cut the book short in half due to health reasons. Anyways, his passing a
big loss and I wish he had been able to complete this book properly.</p><h2 id=fitz>Garth Nix - Sir Hereward and Mister Fitz - 5/5

The first one was, well, "The
Deep Man" (review is further above). I like both characters. This book was
mostly about Inga's character development. I liked the flashbacks that showed
Inga's training and backstory. Some is repeated from the short story <code>flops</code> in

ground combat on the planet. But my absolute favorite was the all out combat in
the last quarter of the book.</p><p>Both Saef and Inga are on both books' covers. In this book, both have suddenly
become "hawt." Saef is now more attractive and Inga has supermodel proportions.
Nothing wrong with attractive characters, but it's a huge contrast compared to
the first book. You can see them side by side here:</p><p><img src=deepman-covers.jpg alt="Covers for The Deep Man and The Silent Hand"></p><h2 id=exlibris>Paula Guran - Ex Libris (Anthology) - 3/5

I'd never read a book like this so
the concept was intriguing. The introduction lists some related books that I am
going to try, too.</p><p>My favorites:</p><ul><li>"In the Stacks": <strong>This is my favorite story of the book</strong>. A group of
magicians fight their way through a magical library to retrieve/return books.
Awesome setting. Scott Lynch also wrote my favorite story from
<a href=#bookofswords>Book of Swords</a> named "The Smoke of Gold is Glory."</li><li>"In Libres": Two students have to venture into a dangerous library (it's a
labyrinth) to retrieve books. Similar to "In the Stacks" (by Scott Lynch), but
not as much action. I didn't know that, Elizabeth Bear, the writer of this
story, and Scott are married.</li><li>"Exchange": Soldier relives his childhood memories revisiting his hometown's
library on his way back from the war.</li><li>"Summer Reading": Very nice short story. A robot maintains an abandoned
library on Earth. Gives away a physical book to a visiting child.</li></ul><p>I liked:</p><ul><li>"Books": Post-apocalyptic setting. Kids encounter a library and steal some
books.</li><li>"Paper Cuts Scissors": Librarian's girlfriend has put herself in a book. He
goes to a mansion where the book characters come alive at midnight to save
her.</li><li>"Magic for Beginners": I loved the setting and the story, but didn't
understand the ending (read it twice). A kid and his friends are fascinated by
a pirate TV show "The Library." He and his mother go on a cross-country trip
to Vegas and kinda end up in the same show? Maybe the show and his friends
were all part of his imagination?</li><li>"What Books Survive": Alien invaders have arrived. People live in barricaded
town. Teenage girl sneaks out to get books from the school. Turns out the
aliens were after knowledge and didn't want to kill humans.</li><li>"Librarian's Dilemma": Should we destroy overly racist/evil books?</li><li>"If on a Winter's Night a Traveler": A secret society dedicated to keeping the
identity of a poet anonymous. They admire and publish her work (one poetry
book), but destroy all mentions of her name.</li><li>"Sigma Structure Symphony": Interesting concept. A librarian is studying the
transmissions of faraway galactic civilizations and it turns out some of them
are actually sentient AIs. She designs a way to convert mathematical theorems
to music, but the alien AI wants more.</li><li>"Last Librarian": Nice premise. A librarian thinks humanity doesn't deserve
books because it's not civilized anymore. They destroy technology (think like
an EMP bomb) and go away with the books. Kinda similar to "Fort Moxie Branch."</li></ul><p>I didn't like or skipped:</p><ul><li>"In the House of the Seven Librarians": Infant grows up in a magic library.
It's nice a story, just not my cup of tea. I was expecting the library to turn
out to be a simulation in the end.</li><li>"Death and the Librarian": I couldn't really connect with the story after 2-3 pages and didn't finish.</li><li>"King of the Big Night Hours": I read this (and some pages twice), but I
didn't get it. A few students commit suicide at the library and things became
weird.</li><li>"Those Who Watch": DNF after a few pages.</li><li>"Special Collections": DNF after a few pages.</li><li>"Inheritance of Barnabas Wilcox": This story didn't have a real connection to
a library. The main character is hired by his former highschool bully to
catalog the books in his new inheritance. It turns out the whole premise was a
spell for the recently diseased to live through the body of the bully and the
inheritance was just a ruse.</li><li>"Midbury Lake Incident": A witch librarian is running away from magical
adversaries who want to get the secrets to the old library of Alexandria. Her
current secret identity in this story is also a librarian.</li><li>"With Tales in Their Teeth, From the Mountain They Came": Soldiers want to
destroy a library. The librarians become the books (as in the books are
written on them) to save them.</li><li>"Green Book": Thoughtcrime of a librarian in an authoritarian theocracy.</li><li>"Woman's Best Friend": Only nominal connection to a library. A women
encounters a man sent to her world. The premise is infinite parallel worlds.</li><li>"Fort Moxie Branch": Aliens preserve the unpublished works of authors. They
think we do not deserve them until we've reached a certain level of
enlightenment.</li></ul></div><footer><p class=meta><span class=categories>Tags:
