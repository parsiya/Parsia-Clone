like the first book (Ready Player One).</p><p>I didn't think it would be possible to cram more 80s references than the first
book, but Ready Player Two did. It's a non-stop vomit. This new book introduces
the concept of "Needlepoints." These are locations in the OASIS that trigger
background music. Every page has at least 2-3 song references played at these
points.</p><p>Following the tradition, the new book also has a series of quests. The quests
are very simple. Most of them are hand$$waved with "I have already done a series
of activities on this planet and have this thingamajig that solves it." At least
3 of them where unnecessary.</p><h2 id=dispatcher01>John Scalzi - The Dispatcher 01 - The Dispatcher - 4/5

horror stories, ranging from "ancient Gods waking up" to "mind-controlling

and followed the footsteps of extinct civilizations.</p><p>The only reason it got 4/5: The story by Orson Scott Card really felt out of
place in this anthology. It really didn't have anything to do with ancient
aliens remains or artifacts. I think they just wanted to include a story by a

distaste for government. Williamson is a libertarian and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_%28novel%29 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Freehold</a>
was a libertarian utopia. I loved it and appreciated his worldview of "small
folks against big government." I didn't question how the big bad sluggish and
incompetent UN became so powerful. I guess this was before I realized I am more
of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Reynolds target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Mack Reynolds</a> type of "big gov hater."</p><p>Most people's problem with this book are the very detailed and graphic sex
scenes. It's a series of soft porn scenes interlaced with Sci-Fi. I also think
they were unnecessary, but hey, "sex sells."</p><p>I am not sure what has happened to the author since the original Freehold book
because he has turned into the online libertarian warrior caricature and a
walking Facebook meme page complaining about the new generation.</p><p>I laughed out loud halfway through the book when in the middle of the
interrogation, the torturer said "my preferred pronouns are xir." I didn't
expect a "pronouns in bio" moment and the main character ranting about trans
people. You wanna make a torturer trans, I have no problem with that, but "xir
is a torturer because xir is trans" was hilarious.</p><p>There were discussions about how minimum wage, employee benefits (Freehold
businesses went bankrupt because they had to provide benefits, lol), work hour
regulations (the torturers couldn't work more than 10 hours, lol), government
mandated contracts, and even warnings on tools/appliances are bad. This is
exactly what grandpa on Facebook says. What makes this more hilarious is the
author served 25 years in the US military which has all of this and more. It's
the biggest socialist jobs program in the country.</p><h2 id=saga02>Kevin Anderson - Saga of the Seven Suns 02 - Forest of Stars - 5/5

"Infiltration" (Griffin Barber), "Insertion" (Chris Kennedy), and "Assault"
(Mike Massa) weaved together. Read the other books before starting this.</p><p>I deducted one star because this is not known beforehand. You're dropped in the
middle of a built universe without much explanation. Some of the concepts of the
book are explained through the book, but some questions are never answered.
Like, who are even the Harvesters?</p><p>There's a lot of text about character backgrounds and their relationships with
the original inhabitants of the system. These are never fully explored because
they're the subject of previous books in the series.</p><p>Other than that, the action is fluid and I liked the how book jumped between

The billion worlds refer to
the almost innumerable habitats, terraformed planets/moons, and modified
asteroids in the solar system (and a few nearby stars) housing trillions of
biological and digital beings. There are genetically modified humans, dolphins,
Martians, and other species mixed with AIs of different intelligence levels.</p><p>The universe offers digital existence, genetic modification, matter printers
(e.g., create almost any matter like food or clothes). Travel is still bound by
physical laws so going around the solar system is slow (and requires
hibernation). There are a few nearby stars that are populated (there's a mention
of ships at half the speed of light).</p><p>The story follows a group of characters (mainly a "robot AI" and a human) in
search of a super weapon. I like the universe and Cambias' writing style.</p><h2 id=billion02>James L. Cambias - Billion Worlds 02 - The Scarab Mission - 5/5

countless species of aliens. I give the world building 6/5 and main character
development 3/5. The extensive world building makes sense when I realized he is
a fantasy tabletop game designer.</p><p>I especially liked how the author had devised a sort of distinctive grammar and
sentence structure in English for the each species' usage of the planet's
"common tongue" language. My favorite is the Itooti's usage of adjectives based
on the tone of the conversation. E.g., "Curious [Name] wants to know why flimsy
looking aliens [referring to humans] are in civilized [city name]."</p><p>Some cons: 2 of the 4 main humans are stock characters and they did not have a
lot of development. A couple of loose ends are not tied.</p><h2 id=kaiju>John Scalzi - The Kaiju Preservation Society - 3/5

<strong>SKIP CHAPTERS 1 AND 2</strong>.</p><p>Chapter 1 is basically non-stop whining about how the American college is woke.
It's how high schoolers who've never been to college or old folks who were in
college decades ago, think it is. The professor is being silenced!</p><p>Chapter 2 is about shooting and how the professor is not a bigot because he has
a gay brother.</p><p>As another reviewer on Goodreads had a fun note. You would expect chapter 3 to
be about quartering soldiers in homes or the 3rd amendment because that's how
the other two were, lol.</p><p>I am not sure <strong>WHY</strong> I actually read these two chapters. I mean I expect
military science fiction to be full of conservatives, but this sort of
nonsense was just too much. It didn't even have to do much with the rest of the

<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Drake target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">David Drake</a> which is basically "the old British navy in space."
I liked the book and the setting because I am a fan of RCN (and David Drake).
The author has published a sequel, <a href=https://www.baen.com/the-silent-hand.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">The Silent Hand</a>.
<del>I will update the booklist and this title when the series gets a name.</del> Seems
like the series names is <del>"Myriad Worlds"</del> "The Deep Man Trilogy" (according
to "The" Silent "Hand" book).</p><p>The setting is an honor-bound society (people duel when their "honor is taken")
ruled by an emperor. There are of course big families juggling for influence.
There are two types of citizens, demi-cits who are provided by the state and
vested citizens who can do what they want. There are ways to become a vested
citizen, but you face an uphill battle because influential families have the
backing of centuries and influence. There's an example of a new vested citizen
almost losing his life. Every military person is a vested citizen.
Officers can purchase their commissions (kinda). There are aliens (Shapers) who
visit every decade and exchange resources for tech. Ship-to-ship action is
mostly close range.</p><p>Saef, the main character is a male vested citizen from an old but poor
traditional family. Very similar to Daniel Leary in RCN who comes from a famous
family but is poor because he's estranged from his rich and famous father.</p><p>Inga Maru is a copy of Adele Mundy from RCN. The loyal but badass female
companion with exceptional abilities. The author has a short story named <code>Flops</code>
that deal with Inga's background. You can read it for free in

I picked up the book because I had
recently enjoyed several anthologies edited by the author. I powered through the
first part of the book, loved the second, and got bored and skimmed the last
parts.</p><p>The setting is interesting and reminded me of Europe during the crusades. It's
yet another feudalism in space, space opera. Religious organization with an
inquisition branch (with its own weapons) that limits what technology is
available to the masses. An emperor that rules through hereditary feudal lords
living in luxury with manipulated genes to live for half a century. Serfs
generally live in poverty. Slavery is legal.</p><p>Faster than light travel is possible, but travel time is still measured in years
between systems so people go into stasis. And of course, a war with an alien
enemy that has been going on for a few hundred years. Allegedly, the settings
was pulled from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Book of the New Sun</a> (people refer to the beginning
paragraphs which are tbh very similar among other things).</p><p>The author is wordy (maybe because he's an editor?). Almost every other page has
a quote from a real or fictional writer/philosopher. There are a lot of things
that could have been skipped.</p><p>My biggest gripe with the book is that same events keep repeating. Does the
author think the readers are stupid and need half a dozen examples of sibling
rivalry and "my parents don't love me" (in the first part) to get the picture?
Or how many scenes of "the chantry are evil" in the last part? Come on :).</p><p>Mild spoilers ahead. The book can be divided into four parts:</p><ul><li>Main character is still on his home planet. Bad father, absent mother, violent
sibling. I did not like this part and just read.</li><li>Moves to a 2nd planet and survives in the streets and the arena. I loved this
part and couldn't put it down.</li><li>His identity is discovered and he moves to the palace. Love triangle. Not great.</li><li>Encounter with the aliens. Chantry messes it up. I skimmed just to finish the book.</li></ul><p>The ending was anti-climactic. I am still going to give the 2nd book a try
(public libraries FTW) and see if it picks up speed. Looks like it's as big as
the first.</p><h2 id=newsun01>Gene Wolfe - Book of the New Sun 01 - The Shadow of the Torturer 3/5

book. OK, I get it, you wanna put all those religious fables and Latin words in
the book. What are all these D&amp;D-like "random encounters" that do not add
anything to the story (e.g., the gardens)?</p><p>I liked the setting. The sun is dying. It's feudal Europe with some existing
advanced technology from the past like portals, flyers, and robots. No one knows
how these things work anymore.</p><p>Anyways, I just finished the book and moved to the 2nd.</p><h2 id=newsun02>Gene Wolfe - Book of the New Sun 02 - The Claw of the Conciliator 4.5/5

This is much better. The pace is faster and the
author actually figured out what they want to do with the main character.</p><p>My only issue with the book is the missing gap between the books. At the end of
book one, the main character is with his group. All are gone when the second
book starts. I thought some pages had been removed from the "Shadow & Claw"
edition of the book that I was reading (combines the first two books), but no.
There are some cryptic explanations of the events through the book, and I was
expecting some extraordinary event, but it was very mundane.</p><p>But I like the writing style of this book better. The inclusion of stories and
the play reminds me of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal%C4%ABla_wa-Dimna target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Kalila wa-Dimna</a> or کلیله و دمنه, one of my
favorite books in Farsi. The stories in that book are like the movie Inception
or Russian dolls. E.g., the main characters start a story and in the middle, one
says, this is like the story of X. Then the X story starts and in the middle,
one of new the characters says, this is just like Y story, and so on. The
stories go a few layers deep.</p><p>In this book, there's only one layer and they're not like "random encounters"
from the first book and actually advance the plot.</p><p>I am gonna take a break before reading the 3rd book.</p><h2 id=bookofswords>Gardner Dozois - Book of Swords (Anthology) - 4/5

Four adventurers storm a mountain to kill a dragon and take its treasure.
Amazing setting and five very interesting characters including the dragon. My
only regret is not finding the concept art of characters before reading the

Assassination attempt at court.</li><li>"The Mocking Tower": Heir to a deceased king tries to steal a sword from a
magical tower. I didn't like the story, but there's an everchanging tower in
the story and every page talks about its new shape in the background. These
descriptions were exotic.</li><li>"The King's Evil": Three adventurers go to a cursed island to recover an
ancient treasure. The main character has an existential crisis (don't we
all?). I did not like the story, but the writing was excellent.</li><li>"The Sons of the Dragon": History of the two sons of an emperor set in the
"Game of Thrones" setting. Reads like a history book. It was full of action,
but meaningless to me because I have neither read the books nor watched the TV
series.</li></ul><p>I didn't like or skipped:</p><ul><li>"Her Father's Sword": Kidnapped villagers return as selfish drones. Girl
struggles to connect with the soulless husk of her father.</li><li>"The Hidden Girl": 10 year old girl is kidnapped and trained as an assassin.
She develops a conscious.<ul><li>"We're all thieves in this world of suffering," the nun says, "Honor and
faith are not virtues, only excuses for stealing more."</li></ul></li><li>"The Sword of Destiny": Wizard's apprentice is sent to steal a magic sword.

The city of Riverside sounds interesting and is part of the author's other
books. I didn't like this story, but I am gonna try some of the other books.</li><li>"The Sword Tyraste": Man tries to avenge his family with the help of a magic
sword. It was an easy read, but very bland.</li></ul><p>Quotes from "The Smoke of Gold is Glory"</p><ul><li>"Anyway, I am famous among my friends for having never in my life behaved with

It's not my cup of tea. The only
reason I am reading them is because they're small books.</p><p>The <a href=/literature/bookreviews/#murderbot01>first book</a> was better. I guess
the idea of the a bot that wants to be independent and watches TV series was
fun, but the other three books quickly got boring and repetitive.</p><p>A whole lot of dialog is dedicated to the murderbot covering its tracks. A good
20% of the books are "I hacked something, I wiped off my movements from logs,
and so on." I think we get the idea that for some reason this bot can hack
anything and everything. Stations are full of security scanners, cameras, and
bots, but they are hackable with a snap.</p><p>Another question is other bots (like the transport ship) don't have governor
modules and can do pretty much any illegal activity they want. People don't like
SecUnits (which have governor modules), but are not afraid of bots or constructs
that do not.</p><h2 id=murderbot05>Martha Wells - Murderbot Diaries 06 - Fugitive Telemetry - 3/5

series) because chronologically the story here happens after the 4th book (Exit
Strategy).</p><p>It's a whodunnit murder mystery. A murder has happened in the station and
murderbot must find the murderer and gain the loyalty of residents. I actually,
liked this book better than the rest mostly because there was not a lot of
words dedicated to "hacking" (see review above).</p><p>Better, but still not my cup of tea.</p><h2 id=icarus01>Timothy Zahn - Icarus Saga 01 - The Icarus Plot - 4/5

Space Opera with a lot of action, extensive universe without a
lot of boring world building.</p><p>There are many references and recurring characters to book 0,
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192528.The_Icarus_Hunt target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">The Icarus Hunt</a> (not sure why Goodreads has numbered it 0 instead of 1).
I suggest you read it first. I didn't and I still enjoyed the book. The
references are explained later.</p><p>Two former bounty hunters turned surveyors are tasked with surveying a planet,
but of course the plot makes them go back to doing what they're good at, finding
people. The book's universe is huge with multiple alien species. An alien race
dominate faster than light travel and an alliance of others including humans
are competing for domination through economic and clandestine warfare.</p><p>I really appreciated how the author didn't have extensive world building
chapters and instead kept the action going on. The last third of the book is a
bit repetitive especially the part were the good people outsmart the bad folks,
and the ending is somewhat cheesy. But I guess it's not space opera if the good
people don't win.</p><p>I will probably read "The Icarus Hunt" before moving to the next book in this
series.</p><h2 id=heroes01>David Drake - Time of Heroes 01 - The Spark - 5/5

I had mostly read
short stories by him in the last few years. I mostly reread
<a href=https://www.baen.com/redliners.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Redliners</a> (DRM-free digital format is free on Baen's website), or
Hammer's Slammers. For the last few years, I used to send him actual snail mail
for his birthday and he would reply via email. This year he didn't and it
turns out he wasn't feeling well.</p><p>I had not read them before, so I picked up the three books in the "Times of
Heroes" series from the local public library for holiday reading. I gobbled the
book in less than a day.</p><p>2023-2024 holiday reading list courtesy of the local public library:</p><p><img src=holiday2023.jpeg alt="2023 holiday reading list"></p><p>I really love the world. There's "the road" that people can use to travel
between nodes. I think it's like a long portal because it's mentioned while it
has light, you cannot see the sun there.</p><p>Nodes are (usually isolated) parcels of land where people can live and is part
of "Here." Monsters and magic items are in "Not-Here" (obviously). In between
these we have "The Waste" which humans can traverse for a bit with the help of
their animal companions with a mental link. Most main characters have one. This
mental link allows them to see through their senses. Our champion has a dog
and fights through his eyes with added agility and reaction time.</p><p>The series is an Arthurian fantasy in a far future world. Champions fight with
energy swords and shields. The ancients have left "magical" items that people
can reshape or reuse. Is it advanced technology or magic? Doesn't matter, you
know the famous quote:</p><blockquote><p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p><p>Arthur C. Clarke</p></blockquote><p>The people who can modify these magical items and reshape them are called
"Makers." They go into a trance and can see and modify the molecular structure
of an artifact to change it. This usually needs extra trace elements (e.g., Iron
or Silicon). Our champion is both a maker and a fighter. We even see some boats
with limited sentience and they can be used to travel between nodes. The boats
are self powered, look like an enclosed cigar, and are airships (I figured this
out after looking at the cover for the 3rd book.)</p><p>The story has a huge gaping hole. I am going to try and not spoil it. Pal
acquires his first kingdom and castle. In the kingdom there's an ancient
artifact that acts like an all-seeing eye. You think of anyone and it will give
you a live feed of them and their immediate surrounding. The artifact is never
used. In the last part of this book Pal nearly dies because a certain person is
missing. No one, including Pal thinks of using this artifact to locate that
person.</p><h2 id=heroes02>David Drake - Time of Heroes 02 - The Storm - 4/5

fan.</p><p>Although most series repeat some background information from previous books,
this ones has too much. Pal (the main character) keeps repeating how he was a
peasant, how he created his original crap equipment, how his current sword and
shield are great, how makers work to restore/reuse artifacts, and how the road
works.</p><p>The major plot in this book is also another missing person. Again, no one thinks
of using the all-seeing eye artifact from the previous book to look for them.
What was the reason for even including the artifact originally?</p><p>The main quest in this book is also abandoned for quite a while. Pal goes around
and does side quests while there's no progress on the main quest. I mean, this
is the typical open world RPG tabletop or videogame, but still.</p><p>It's shorter than the previous book. I borrowed the hardcover versions from the
library. The first book is 340 pages and this one is 280. The next book is
considerably shorter.</p><h2 id=heroes03>David Drake - Time of Heroes 03 - The Serpent - 3/5

The disappointment continues. The length
of the book is again, smaller. From 340 pages in the first book, to 280 in the
second, and finally 180 pages here (these are all hardcover editions I borrowed
from the public library).</p><p>Of course, the redundancy continues. Yes, Pal was born a peasant, doesn't like
the court, his past equipment was crap, his current equipment is great, he can
predict attacks with his dog, he has a boat, and so on. There was no need to
mention these multiple times during the book.</p><p>This book doesn't have a main quest or major plot. It's easier to think of this
book as a series of short stories in that setting. I guess that's why there's
excessive repeating. Each story needs to mention some of the background info.
Unfortunately, the plots of stories are kind of similar. Pal goes to some node
to solve a conflict, ends up killing the ruler (through no fault of his own,
lol) and takes over the node for the commonwealth (and reluctantly pockets half
of the taxes).</p><p>One of the stories introduced an interesting concept. A female maker.
Unfortunately, the character appears in only one story and very briefly.</p><p>Another disappointing point for me were the artifacts. So many amazing artifacts
were introduced by the end of the third book, but most of them (like the
all-seeing eye) were never used or mentioned.</p><p>There are a lot of loose ends in this book. I think Mr. Drake (whom I admire a
lot) cut the book short in half due to health reasons. Anyways, his passing a
big loss and I wish he had been able to complete this book properly.</p><h2 id=fitz>Garth Nix - Sir Hereward and Mister Fitz - 5/5

The first one was, well, "The

mostly about Inga's character development. I liked the flashbacks that showed
Inga's training and backstory. Some is repeated from the short story <code>flops</code> in

become "hawt." Saef is now more attractive and Inga has supermodel proportions.

<a href=#bookofswords>Book of Swords</a> named "The Smoke of Gold is Glory."</li><li>"In Libres": Two students have to venture into a dangerous library (it's a
labyrinth) to retrieve books. Similar to "In the Stacks" (by Scott Lynch), but
not as much action. I didn't know that, Elizabeth Bear, the writer of this
story, and Scott are married.</li><li>"Exchange": Soldier relives his childhood memories revisiting his hometown's
library on his way back from the war.</li><li>"Summer Reading": Very nice short story. A robot maintains an abandoned
library on Earth. Gives away a physical book to a visiting child.</li></ul><p>I liked:</p><ul><li>"Books": Post-apocalyptic setting. Kids encounter a library and steal some
books.</li><li>"Paper Cuts Scissors": Librarian's girlfriend has put herself in a book. He
goes to a mansion where the book characters come alive at midnight to save
her.</li><li>"Magic for Beginners": I loved the setting and the story, but didn't
understand the ending (read it twice). A kid and his friends are fascinated by
a pirate TV show "The Library." He and his mother go on a cross-country trip
to Vegas and kinda end up in the same show? Maybe the show and his friends
were all part of his imagination?</li><li>"What Books Survive": Alien invaders have arrived. People live in barricaded
town. Teenage girl sneaks out to get books from the school. Turns out the
aliens were after knowledge and didn't want to kill humans.</li><li>"Librarian's Dilemma": Should we destroy overly racist/evil books?</li><li>"If on a Winter's Night a Traveler": A secret society dedicated to keeping the
identity of a poet anonymous. They admire and publish her work (one poetry
book), but destroy all mentions of her name.</li><li>"Sigma Structure Symphony": Interesting concept. A librarian is studying the
transmissions of faraway galactic civilizations and it turns out some of them
are actually sentient AIs. She designs a way to convert mathematical theorems
to music, but the alien AI wants more.</li><li>"Last Librarian": Nice premise. A librarian thinks humanity doesn't deserve
books because it's not civilized anymore. They destroy technology (think like
an EMP bomb) and go away with the books. Kinda similar to "Fort Moxie Branch."</li></ul><p>I didn't like or skipped:</p><ul><li>"In the House of the Seven Librarians": Infant grows up in a magic library.
It's nice a story, just not my cup of tea. I was expecting the library to turn
out to be a simulation in the end.</li><li>"Death and the Librarian": I couldn't really connect with the story after 2-3 pages and didn't finish.</li><li>"King of the Big Night Hours": I read this (and some pages twice), but I
didn't get it. A few students commit suicide at the library and things became
weird.</li><li>"Those Who Watch": DNF after a few pages.</li><li>"Special Collections": DNF after a few pages.</li><li>"Inheritance of Barnabas Wilcox": This story didn't have a real connection to
a library. The main character is hired by his former highschool bully to
catalog the books in his new inheritance. It turns out the whole premise was a
spell for the recently diseased to live through the body of the bully and the
inheritance was just a ruse.</li><li>"Midbury Lake Incident": A witch librarian is running away from magical
adversaries who want to get the secrets to the old library of Alexandria. Her
current secret identity in this story is also a librarian.</li><li>"With Tales in Their Teeth, From the Mountain They Came": Soldiers want to
destroy a library. The librarians become the books (as in the books are
written on them) to save them.</li><li>"Green Book": Thoughtcrime of a librarian in an authoritarian theocracy.</li><li>"Woman's Best Friend": Only nominal connection to a library. A women
encounters a man sent to her world. The premise is infinite parallel worlds.</li><li>"Fort Moxie Branch": Aliens preserve the unpublished works of authors. They
think we do not deserve them until we've reached a certain level of
enlightenment.</li></ul><h2 id=www4>Sean Patrick Hazlett - Weird World War IV (Anthology) - 4/5

In some cases, the nukes flew and the civilization has
been destroyed, and in other cases some nukes were used, and in the last, no
nukes. These short stories are about World War 4.</p><p>Most stories assumed WW4 is happening soon after WW3 and is fought by humans.
"Chaos Redeemed," "Mea Kaua," and "Lupus Belli" had new species.</p><p>I loved:</p><ul><li>"Deep Trouble": The US is losing the war and some people decide to wake up
something ancient. I did not expect the ending. Nicely done.</li><li>"Reflections in Lizard-time": Two groups of aliens have arrived from a

own creations. A mercenary is hired to move a floating city.</li><li>"Eureka Alternative": China has nuked the US. A secret US program is sending
soldiers into alternate timelines to find a weapon to win the war. A soldier
and herself from a different timeline find a possible solution.</li><li>"Future and Once": Written in the form of a play. Merlin (from the Arthurian
legends) and a soldier traverse the aftermath of WW3.</li></ul><p>I liked:</p><ul><li>"Big Whimper (the Further Adventures of Rex, Two Million CE)": Aliens
destroyed humans in WW3, a robot dog is out for revenge after two million
years.</li><li>"We Are Not Monsters": Interesting concept. Person discovers corporations have
become sentient.</li><li>"Twilight of the God Makers": Humanity created monsters to win WW3, but is losing its grip on them.</li><li>"Door of Return": A group of Africans try to reclaim their magic to change the future.</li><li>"Offering the King Makes": A group of soldiers go into the Egyptian after-life
looking for weapons to win WW4 and meet some ancient mythological figures.</li><li>"Astral Soldier": As a result of a new weapon used in WW3, some people can
do astral projection. A group of American soldiers is trying to pacify Panama
from rebels. The concept was interesting, I wish the story had more action.</li><li>"Wave Forms": Everyone got some sort of magic and the world changed (that's
supposedly WW3). Powerful magic users rule city states. A person whose magical
ability is living in a different body every day, is recruited into the
resistance.</li><li>"Ancient-enemy": Neanderthals have returned from beneath the surface to take
their revenge. A group of human prisoners put up some resistance.</li><li>"Day in the Life of a Suicide Geomancer": WW3 has destroyed most technology,
but magic has resurfaced. Necromancers threaten the world. A native American
ritual destroys the undead and revitalizes the Earth.</li></ul><p>I didn't like or skipped:</p><ul><li>"Transformation Problem": A group of people have fled Earth in a spaceship.
Space anomalies start to pop-up along their route.</li><li>"Triplicate": Williamson is whining about the "woke" again. DNF. I had learned
my lesson so I stopped at the end of the first page instead of wasting my time
like I had with <a href=#gordian01>The Gordian Protocol</a> and
<a href=#freehold07>Angeleyes</a>.</li><li>"Portals of the Past": Time travel, young Hitler, and changing the past.</li><li>"Line in the Stars": WW3 resulted in two major groups. Advanced orbitals and
people on Earth. A group of soldiers infiltrate an orbital to prevent WW4.</li><li>"Lupus Belli": Some people have become werewolves in WW3. They are 2nd class
citizens. Convicted werewolves are sent to the moon for their sentence. A

There's a fair amount of gunslinger
action in the book. The main character doesn't use any augmentations and the
augmented are usually easily defeated by the protagonists.</p><p>The "Joint Council" rules the Earth with an iron first. The "System Cops" are
the ultimate authority. Most people live a desperate life of poverty and die
young. The main character mentions many times that at 27 years old, he has lived
too long.</p><p>There's a new religion, the electric church. The converts are turned into cyborg
monks. Rumor has it most of them were converted unwillingly and inside each monk
is a screaming human brain unable to get out.</p><p>The main character, Avery Cates is a gunner (AKA gun for hire). He is hired to
kill the head of the electric church.</p><p>This is the first of a series of 5 books and many short stories. I liked the

A lot of stories
revolve around the US and USSR fighting either in alternate history or using
magic/supernatural weapons. A lot of decent stories, but nothing to write home
about.</p><p>I loved:</p><ul><li>"Shadow Rook Red": The US and the USSR are fighting on both Earth and a shadow
realm. People can go from one to the other quite easily with a "toggle
device." An expert in the other world is kidnapped.</li><li>"Ouroboros Arrangement": What if Earth had a guardian angel that prevented catastrophes?</li></ul><p>I liked:</p><ul><li>"Price": Decent David Drake story. The US and the USSR are fighting. Both
sides are using shamans.</li><li>"Where You Lead, I Will Follow: An Oral History of the Denver Incident":
Interesting concept. People are addicted to an app that gives them rewards for
performing tasks. The app causes a catastrophe by telling a large group of
people to performing small independent tasks.</li><li>"All Quiet on the Phantom Front": The NATO and the USSR are fighting. The
soviets are winning by using magic. A group of NATO officers try to locate
missing soldiers.</li><li>"Anastasia's Egg": I liked the story but it had nothing to do with WW3. It
turns out a few historical figures are magic users and Earth wars/revolutions
are proxy wars between them.</li><li>"Tap, Tap, Tapping in the Deep": Two US deep divers are trying to tap a soviet
undersea cable. They encounter a hostile creature made of magic and tech.</li><li>"No Plan Survives First Contact": The soviets have advanced alien tech. Two

USSR (lol). A soviet soldier is tasked with extracting a scientist with a big
secret.</li><li>"Deniability": The US and the soviets kill assassinate the other side's heads

reading (you can see the gap in the book list) and I finished the second half of
the book in September 2024.</p><p>This is an anthology about parallel worlds. I don't remember most of the stories
in the first half of the book so my reviews might not be great. Usually, I write
these reviews right after finishing the book.</p><p><strong>My absolute favorite story of the book</strong> was "Crystal Halloway and the
Forgotten Passage" by Seanan McGuire. You can also read it online at
<a href=https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/fm/fiction/crystal-halloway-and-the-forgotten-passage/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/fm/fiction/crystal-halloway-and-the-forgotten-passage/</a>.</p><p>I loved it so much that I want to put it here to remember. It was one of the
most depressingly fantastic stories I have ever read. The way we forget our
fantasies after we "grow up." Maybe we still read SFF and play videogames
because it helps us keep that spark alive.</p><p>The last few paragraphs are depressing.</p><blockquote><p>And none of them, not Crystal, not her parents, could hear the distant,
thready sound of a giant spider—the Guardian of the Passage to the Beyond, the
one who had guided and guarded a hundred generations of human children,
nurtured them, loved them, and lost them all—weeping.</p></blockquote><p><img src=crystal1.png alt></p><p>My favorites (other than the one above):</p><ul><li>"The Lonely Songs of Laren Dorr" by George R. R. Martin: Amazing story. A warrior travels between worlds through gates in search of her lover who was taken from him by the Gods. She enters an empty world with a single occupant who was banished there by the Gods. They stay together for a while. But eventually she has to leave.</li><li>"Impossible Dreams" by Tim Pratt: Movie buff visits a video store from an alternate reality where some movies have not been made or made with a different cast. He keeps going back every day to chat with the young attendant and falls in love with her.</li><li>"Like Minds" by Robert Reed: This was a really nice story. There's a being called "the Authority" that exists in all different realities and worlds. People can ask it for three things at a time (e.g., a book about a life of theirs in an alternate world where they are God or a movie of them making love to someone). In return they have to offer three things of their own (e.g., a journal or a work of art). The Authority reminds me of LLMs (Large Language Models) creating alternate histories or endings to works of fiction and so on which are all the craze in 2024.</li></ul><p>I liked:</p><ul><li>"Moon Six" by Stephen Baxter: An astronaut keeps transitioning between alternate realities.</li><li>"Twenty-Two Centimeters" by Gregory Benford: Nice setting. Humans go to a parallel Earth and meet aliens who have a message for them.</li><li>"The Thirteen Texts of Arthyria" John R. Fultz: Nice story. A man seeks and reads subsequent volumes of a book about the "One True World." With each book he is transported further into an alternate reality.</li><li>"Ruminations in an Alien Tongue" by Vandana Singh: Humans are studying an abandoned alien structure. A man keeps arriving from different timelines looking for his love, to no avail.</li><li>"Ten Sigmas" by Paul Melko: A man and his collective counterparts in all parallel worlds examine different choices of actions and their consequences on different worlds. E.g., if they decide to stop a kidnapper, most of them will die, but a few will survive.</li><li>"The Cristóbal Effect" by Simon McCaffery: Guy travels to alternate universes, changes the reality to create works of art that never existed. E.g., influence actors/directors to make movies that do not exist in his world. Then he sells them to the highest bidder in his world. The story mainly involves an actor who was not meant to be one, but becomes a miserable actor. In the end, he is caught by the authorities and placed into the actor's body just before his death in a car crash.<ul><li>Nice quote "All existence is a theft paid for by other existences; no life flowers except on a cemetery. — Remy de Gourmont"</li></ul></li><li>"Signal to Noise" by Alastair Reynolds: It's possible to tap into alternate realities, but only for a few days before the signal to noise ratio becomes so bad that color vision and sense turn into black and white vision, then voice only and finally only text. Man who has recently lost his wife goes to an alternate reality for a few days to spend time with her alternate self. I think it's an allegory of his wife also experiencing losing him.</li><li>"Porridge on Islac" by Ursula K. Le Guin: Traveler goes to alternate worlds. In this specific world, some people have mixed genes with plants and animals because the gene scientists decided to mix everything together and messed up. People with these mixed genes are considered second-class citizens and inferior. It's an exploration of how different a world can be.</li><li>"Mrs. Todd's Shortcut" by Stephen King: A lady is obsessed with taking shortcuts during drives between states. The caretaker of her house travels with her by such a shortcut that is physically impossible. It might be a gateway to another world.</li><li>"The Ontological Factor" by David Barr Kirtley: Man goes to his deceased uncle's house to tally his belongings. He finds gateways to different worlds with different levels of sophistication (e.g., ours is a level 5, max is 10).</li><li>"Dear Annabehls" by Mercurio D. Rivera: Written in the style of letters to magazine columns and their answers. It talks about a world where traveling to parallel Earths is possible so people come and go as they please and there can be multiples of someone.</li><li>"The Goat Variations" by Jeff VanderMeer: A US president is introduced to a secret project, a time machine. The president is visiting a school in September 2001 and experiences alternate realities of the 9/11 attacks happening. In some, it doesn't happen, in some he orders a nuclear strike and so on.</li><li>"Flower, Mercy, Needle, Chain" by Yoon Ha Lee: An ancient assassin is tasked with destroying a weapon. The weapon destroys the superior of the one who is shot.</li><li>"The Magician and the Maid and Other Stories" by Christie Yant: A woman is searching for her lost lover who left their village to become a powerful magician. She visits a magician in a different world for clues on how to find him. Turns out he is her lost lover and they were meant to be together in this reality.</li></ul><p>I didn't like or skipped:</p><ul><li>"A Brief Guide to Other Histories" by Paul McAuley: A squad of soldiers go to an occupied alternate Earth. The main character goes to see his own double on alternate Earth.</li><li>"An Empty House with Many Doors" by Michael Swanwick: Guy who has lost his wife goes to an alternate reality and meets her. While it was a nice story, it was cliche. However, I think it was meant for readers who have lost someone close, so I cannot dismiss it as a bad story. Just not my cup of tea.</li><li>"Ana's Tag" by William Alexander: Girl's brother goes missing. He has gone to a magical land. She follows him.</li><li>"Nothing Personal" by Pat Cadigan: I lost interest a few pages in and skipped it.</li><li>"The Rose Wall" by Joyce Carol Oates: Kid leaves home to go into a city and enters an alternate universe where he has not been born.</li><li>"Magic for Beginners" by Kelly Link: I had already read it in "Ex Libris" (review above). It looks like a really nice story that I should "get." But I did not (again).</li><li>"[a ghost samba]" by Ian McDonald: Man finds an undiscovered music album from his favorite composer. Realizes there are infinite parallel universes.</li><li>"Beyond Porch and Portal" by E. Catherine Tobler: Lady in post industrial revolution Baltimore is transported to a magical world.</li><li>"Of Swords and Horses" by Carrie Vaughn: A girl goes missing. She returns for a brief visit and talks to her mother about her journey and life in a different world where they are fighting demons who want to destroy all realities.</li><li>"The City of Blind Delight" by Catherynne M. Valente: A man visits a different city with a train. While the setting appeared to be intriguing, I couldn't connect with the story. Sure, the other city is like another world, but how is it special?</li><li>"Angles" by Orson Scott Card: People have found a way to travel to alternate version of Earth. Japan is under the occupation of China in this world. A group of Japanese seek passage to a different Earth where they can live free.</li><li>"Trips" by Robert Silverberg: Man goes between parallel worlds in San Francisco. He meets different people and his wife in a different reality where they had not met. He returns home to find it, not being home, but a very close version of his reality which he has to leave again.</li></ul><h2 id=citizens>John Ringo & Brian Thomsen - Anthology - Citizens - 3.5/5

Interestingly, I did not know Gene Wolfe and Arthur C.
Clarke were veterans.</p><p>I loved:</p><ul><li>"Field Test" by Keith Laumer: Bolo stories are always fun. Bolos are autonomous fighting machines. Later generations (this one is generation 20) are very huge. This one was not authorized to perform a test, but a neighboring nation attacked and so the Bolo went on and saved the day "for the honor of the regiment."</li><li>"Horars of War" by Gene Wolfe: There's a clone army fighting a war. Embedded with them is a human who has pretended to be a clone to write stories. He bonds with them so much that he dies defending them and as one of them.</li><li>"Under the Hammer" by David Drake: I've read every Hammer's Slammers story at least three times, but I read it again. A new recruit's first firefight as a Slammer.</li></ul><p>I liked:</p><ul><li>"Allamagoosa" by Erik Frank Russell: A ship is getting inspected. They have to check that every part is present and accounted for. They see something named "offog" in their list that doesn't exist. So they claim they had one and it was destroyed. It turns out the item on the list was "Dog" and they claimed the ship dog disintegrated under gravitational stress.</li><li>"Exploration Team" by Murray Leinster: A guy is illegally colonizing a planet with some intelligent mutated bears (I think there was a bat, too). An inspector lands to investigate a legally established colony that used machines. They form a truce to figure out what happened to the last colony and survive. Moral of the story: those mutated living beings are superior to the machines for establishing colonies.</li><li>"Superiority" by Arthur C. Clarke: A letter from a general awaiting court martial that explains why their side lost a war despite being technologically superior to their enemy. They lost because they over-engineered their solutions.</li><li>"Peace With Honor" by Jerry Pournelle: A member of the current government is losing the next presidential election. Apparently, this means chaos. He sets up some members of the rival to fall in order to win. Turns out one of them is her daughter's fiancé, what a sacrifice, lol.<ul><li>I remember reading this story before, but I do not remember when or where. It is set in the Falkenberg's legion universe so it might have been there?</li><li>You can read it with a few others in the sample chapters of <a href=https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781982124175/9781982124175_toc.htm target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">"The Best of Jerry Pournelle" on Baen's site</a>, maybe there?</li></ul></li><li>"Time Piece" by Joe W. Haldeman: Interstellar war between humans and another species. Similar to "Forever War," the soldiers spend most of their time in transit while the world goes by. A vet has spent around 500 years in transit and cannot connect with society anymore, even the language has changed.</li><li>"Question" by Patrick A. Vanner: Good action scenes. A soldier is part of the guard duty for a diplomat who is making contact with a new species. The new species are cat-like. A member of the delegation is allergic to them and sneezes all over their leader (along with a lot of body fluids). This starts a shootout and the main character tries to extract the humans and escape.</li><li>"Long Watch" by Robert A. Heinlein: Mutineers want to take control of atomic bombs on the moon and nuke the Earth. A soldier stops them by sacrificing himself and dies of radioactivity.</li></ul><p>I didn't like or skipped:</p><ul><li>"Fireproof" by Hal Clement: Countries have orbital stations with nuclear torpedoes as a form of deterrence. One spy infiltrates a rival country to destroy it. "Akshually, it was about physics in space."</li><li>"Neither Sleet, Nor Snow, Nor Alien Invasion" by Dave Freer: Comedy story. A postman (and zoologist) makes first contact with an invading species and makes a deal with them so humans become interstellar post and package delivery people.</li><li>"Light" by Kacey Grannis: Two American helicopter pilots crash in Iraq (I guess it's during the Iraq invasion). They flee on foot, but get captured. They turn into mythical shadow creatures that are invisible during the day.</li><li>"Price" by Michael Z. Williamson: Story in the Freehold universe. Part of the action where their covert teams destroyed UN assets at the end of the book. It's a good mil-scifi story if you skip the parts where Williamson is whining about the "woke," again, lol.</li><li>"Earth's First Improved Chimp Gets a Job as a Janitor" by John Ringo: "Good guy with a gun annihilates school invaders" fantasy, I mean it's Ringo after all. The good guy is a mutated first gen killing chimp who works as a janitor and destroys all the bad people with an awakened generation two student (human this time).</li></ul><h2 id=billion03>James L.

As
usual Cambias is great with world building (6/5). I am not sure if the
characters are just shallow or appear shallow compared to his excellent world
building. They are very plain (3/5).</p><p>I went to the New Westminster public library in British Columbia and was just
browsing when I found it. It had been in the library for less than a month
before. Overall, a great book, finished it in less than a day.</p><p>This book continues the adventure from the first book. We have Adya, Zee, and our
AI friend Daslakh. They have returned to Adya's home moon, Miranda. Adya is a
member of the ruling elite (the sixty families). Her family has fallen on hard
times.</p><p>I will not spoil the ending, but the last few pages continued with the theme of
some sort of evil being pulling strings from the shadows to make all the trouble
in the three books in the series.</p><h2 id=endtimes>Robert Silverberg - Anthology - This Way to the End times - 4/5

Guyal of Sfere (sphere?) sets out to find the Curator who has the answers to everything. The sun is dying and humanity is in a post civilization phase and is kinda feudal with some technology existing but it's mostly regarded as magic (there's also magic apparently). Unironically, the name of the book where this story was originally printed and the name of the setting is called "The Dying Earth."<ul><li>It reminded me of the Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe.</li><li>I will definitely read these series, soon. I am not sure why I never did. Looking at my <a href=/literature/booklist/>book list</a> I read two Jack Vance stories in 2006 (The Last Castle and To Live Forever) and I never continued reading from him?</li><li>Quote: "An ancient principle specifies that, in order to destroy a substance, the nature of the substance must be determined."</li></ul></li><li>"Screwfly Solution" by James Tiptree Jr (pen name of Alice Bradley): My 2nd favorite story in the book. Humanity is killing itself off. The men appear to be infected with a virus that makes them kill women. It turns out this disease is induced by some extraterrestrial beings who want a new planet. The last sentences of the story is amazing:<ul><li>"But it wasn't an angel. <em>I think I saw a real estate agent</em>."</li></ul></li><li>"Heresies of the Huge God" by Brian W. Aldiss: This was a unique story about a very giant being (the Huge God) landing on Earth and changing the Earth's climate leading to the end of the world. It is narrated from the eyes of a priest of a religion created after worshiping this huge being.</li><li>"Daisy, in the Sun" by Connie Willis: More of a fantasy story. Daisy loves the sun and it turns out she is stuck in a world created from her last days on Earth before the sun went nova.<ul><li>I'd never heard of Connie Willis, but it looks like I might like her stories so I will try them.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I liked:</p><ul><li>"Eternal Adam" by Jules Verne: I started my sci-fi craze with Verne in my teens. This was a good story. A member of a future race of humans discovers a series of letters that explains why their entire civilization is on one big island and the rest of the planet is just water.</li><li>"Last Generation" by James Elroy Flecker: The wind of time takes a human to the future where he narrates the demise of society because a king makes every human sterile.</li><li>"Finis" by Frank Lillie Pollock: It turns out there's this big star in the center of the galaxy and well, humanity ends when the rays of this big star reach Earth. This was a novel "end of the world" cause.</li><li>"Coming of the Ice" by G. Peyton Wertenbaker: A man becomes immortal (and in the process loses emotions) and narrates the end of humanity when the entire planet goes into an ice age. He dies when he starts feeling love again.</li><li>"N Day" by Philip Latham: A modern-day astronomer predicts the sun is going nova in a few days. No one believes him, but guess who has the last laugh?</li><li>"Pail of Air" by Fritz Leiber: The unique title is why it's in the "I liked" section instead of "I didn't like." It's a generic story. A black star has stolen Earth from the sun and carried it away. The Earth is cold and the air has frozen in layers so they literally have to go get buckets of oxygen. A kid and his family are barely surviving in this world, but not all hope is lost.</li><li>"New Atlantis" by Ursula K. Le Guin: A great story by any other writer, but a mediocre one from the great Ursula Le Guin. In a future US, an authoritarian bureaucracy has killed scientific innovation (ironically China is doing research) and has a tight grip on society by holding all forms of energy creation hostage. A group of renegade scientists create a new way to gather cheap solar energy, but the world is also ending from ecological disasters.<ul><li>Quote: "There are various degrees of death, and time spares us none of them."</li><li>Quote: "sound is local, as sight is not."</li></ul></li><li>"When We Went to See the End of the World" by Robert Silverberg: In a dinner party, almost everyone has paid for an expensive trip "to the end of time." But they have all seen different endings that do not match. During the narration, there are news items and chatter about constant disasters happening in their current world (e.g., Los Angeles is destroyed by a quake or mutated amoeba is released into the wild). It was a clever way of saying people were paying to see a fabricated end of the world (their versions did not match) while the world is ending around them and they are too busy to notice.</li><li>"Wind and the Rain" by Robert Silverberg: The Earth has been destroyed but humanity survived by fleeing to the stars. The story is from the viewpoint of a future member of the ecological clean up crew on Earth. They explain the folly of ancient humans (e.g., storing radioactive waste that lasts for millions of years in barrels that last hundreds).</li></ul><p>I didn't like or skipped:</p><ul><li>"Who Can Replace a Man?" Brian W. Aldiss: Humanity is dying so it created intelligent machines. Things with class 1 to class 8 brains (lower == more intelligent). The machines revolt and start fighting when there are no more orders from humans. A group of machines from a farm go far away from other machines to create their own civilization, but, well!</li><li>"After-images" by Malcolm Edwards: I would have skipped this if it wasn't short. The world ended and a village is surrounded by some walls of energy. Two inhabitants try to explore these.</li><li>"Three Days After" by Karen Haber: The world ended and a lady is either stuck in a time loop or just waiting to die. I didn't get it. Again, I did not skip it because it was only a few pages.</li><li>"Rain at the End of the World as We Know It" by Dale Bailey: Everyone is dead except one guy. He goes around the town and lives in a different house. A woman also shows up. He fixes her a drink.</li><li>"Final Exam" by Megan Arkenberg: This was a unique story in the form of an exam's multiple choice questions and answer sheet. I did not connect with the story. Shambling horrors came out of the sea, killed people for a while and then left. This is the story of a woman and her estranged husband.</li><li>"Prayers to the Sun by a Dying Person" by Alvaro Zinos-Amaro: A girl comes from the future to get help from a woman to save the world. They go to the end of time to find the cause of the end of the world.</li><li>"Last and First Men" by Olaf Stapledon: This is the last two (?) chapters of a book by the same name. It talks about the struggles of the 18th men (1st men are our species) who are doomed and are trying to propagate themselves through the galaxy.</li></ul></div><footer><p class=meta><span class=categories>Tags:
