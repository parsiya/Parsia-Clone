title: "Ematic EP205 Bluetooth Speaker Battery Replacement"
wip: false
---

I had this EP205 Bluetooth speaker from the brand Ematic from 2014 (bought for
10 USD). In 2024 I realized it doesn't work when it's unplugged so the battery
must be bad. This is a guide on how to replace the battery.

It was a nice speaker. Used mini USB to charge and had a bunch of accessories
like a car charger. It's still for sale on [Amazon][az].

Looking at the reviews (mostly from 2016), it looks like everyone had the same
issue (battery doesn't hold a charge). I did not have this issue back then, only
after a decade when I found it in the electronics/cable box.

Spoiler alert: The battery is actually easy to change without completely opening
the speaker, but my battery was bloated and I could not get it out.

First, we remove the plastic flaps and then open the metal net. Unbend (?) these
two parts to remove it.

Now you have the speaker, open these screws.

Don't yank the parts off, open one side to see these two connectors that should
be removed.

And then finally the battery that could not be removed without lifting the PCB.

It's a BL-5C battery.

I bought one for 5 USD and then donated the speaker. Hopefully, it has found a
new life.
