# Parsia Clone
This is my clone. I have been maintaining one internally at Cigital/Synopsys since mid 2016. It has been decently successful and well received. I have decided to make a public one too. There is going to be a lot of redundancy between here and [parsiya.net][parsiya-net] but that is expected. This repository will also contain code and random notes that do not get published there effectively removing the Random-Code and Random-Notes repositories I recently started.

The clone resides at [parsiya.io][parsiya-io]. Previously, the articles were added via git and the index was manually generated. You can see the old (and outdated) read me at [old-readme.md](Old-READMD.md).

I have explained how I create the resulting website in these two blog posts:

- [Semi-Automated Cloning: Pain-Free Knowledge Base Creation](https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-04-24-semi-automated-cloning-pain-free-knowledge-base-creation/)
