# Parsia Clone ![Deploy Clone](https://github.com/parsiya/parsia-clone/workflows/Deploy%20Blog/badge.svg)
This is my clone. I have been maintaining one internally at my work
(Cigita/Synopsys/EA) since mid 2016. It has been decently successful and well
received. I have decided to make a public one. There is going to be a lot of
redundancy between here and [parsiya.net][parsiya-net] but that is expected.
This repository will also contain code and random notes that do not get
published there effectively removing the Random-Code and Random-Notes
repositories I recently started.

The clone resides at [parsiya.io][parsiya-io]. Previously, the articles were
added via git and the index was manually generated. You can see the old (and
outdated) read me at [old-readme.md](Old-READMD.md).

I have explained how I create the resulting website in these two blog posts:

- [Deploying my Knowledge Base at parsiya.io to S3 with Travis CI](https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-04-24-deploying-my-knowledge-base-at-parsiya.io-to-s3-with-travis-ci/)
    - As of November 2020, I am using Github actions instead of Travis CI. See
      the [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file for
      details. The old travis file is [.travis.yml](.travis.yml).
- [Semi-Automated Cloning: Pain-Free Knowledge Base Creation](https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-04-24-semi-automated-cloning-pain-free-knowledge-base-creation/)
