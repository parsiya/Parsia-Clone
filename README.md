# Parsia Clone ![Deploy Clone](https://github.com/parsiya/parsia-clone/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)
This is my clone. I have been maintaining one internally at my work
(Cigital/Synopsys/Electronic Arts) since mid 2016. It has been decently
successful and well received. There is going to be some expected redundancy
between here and [parsiya.net][parsiya-net]. This repository will also contain
code and random notes that do not get published there, effectively removing the
Random-Code and Random-Notes repositories.

[parsiya-net]: https://parsiya.net

As of February 2021, the site is built with GitHub actions and hosted on GitHub
pages at [parsiya.io][parsiya-io].
