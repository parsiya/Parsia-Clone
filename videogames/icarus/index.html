First we need to
research the item and then pay another fee to craft it. You get the actual item
after crafting. After the first research, you can just keep crafting.</p><p>Items are lost if they are left on the planet. You need to bring them back with
you either in your inventory or in the dropship cargo slot when you are leaving
a mission.</p><p>If your items break, they are magically repaired when you take them back to the
station. <strong>Don't throw away workshop items</strong>.</p><ol><li>Canteen: Drink once and it will refill the canteen. You don't need to worry
about water for a long time. It also reduces your body temperature which is
useful in the desert.</li><li>O2 Canister: Build a <code>Crafting Bench</code> and then build an <code>Oxite Dissolver</code> to
fill it with Oxite and Sulfur.</li><li>Knife: These increase the skinning yield which give you more Leather and Fur.
The original <code>MXC Knife</code> is a good start. As you get more Ren, move to
<code>Qie</code> knife for skinning speed and better yield.</li><li>Pickaxe: Not only they have better mining yields, they break later. <code>MXC</code> and
then <code>Heike</code> are good starting pickaxes. Later down the road you want to go
for the <code>Neves</code> pickaxe.</li><li>Envirosuit: <code>Duo</code> is a good start to open up but go for <code>Hark</code>.</li><li>Armor: When you get some Exotics, open (but not craft) the line towards the
left and get one of the <code>Bihu</code> or <code>Dongtian</code> envirosuits. Then craft the
Naneo armor which only need Ren. THIS WILL HELP ALOT.<ol><li>Later you want to go for the <code>CX-400</code> armor for the Ore yield.</li></ol></li><li>IC-001 Radar: It has its own power source and makes finding Exotic veins
easy. You can also use it like a "wildlife attraction" module to get them to
come to you and kill them for meat, fur, leather, and bone. Makes the initial
grind for these easier.</li><li>Mass Dampener Module: Increases speed. When you get an envirosuit with slots,
buy a few (they stack). They are very useful for Exotic farms because a lot
of your time is spent running between veins and the dropship.</li><li>Backpack: The initial <code>Survival Backpack</code> is super cheap and awesome. Later
you can specialize. I use the 12 slot backpack now.</li><li>Biofuel Can: For mining Exotics, it's more than enough to run the
<code>Biofuel Generator</code> to extract three veins.</li></ol><h1 id=icarusintelcom>icarusintel.com

just farming Exotics. I usually tech up in a star cave near the target location
or the nearest star cave to the drop pod.</p><p>Note I have some workshop items like armor, pickaxe, axe, knife, canteen, O2
canister and speed modules.</p><ol><li>Grab all your stuff from the pod. Press the interact button while facing it
and click <code>Take All</code>. This will put on the armor and put things in the
hotbar.</li><li>Grab some sticks and stones to make a wood bow if I do not have my Larkwell
Bow. Make some stone arrows.</li><li>Drop the workshop radar if I want to farm Exotics. This also helps attract
wildlife for food, etc.</li><li>Move to the target location if I need to build something. Usually a big cave
(star or rank 3 based on icarusintel.com). Drink some water while going
there.</li><li>Kill some wildlife to get some stuff.</li><li>Make a <code>Bone Sickle</code> and some <code>Bone Arrows</code> (kill cave worms faster).</li><li>Mine some Sulfur, Oxite, Silica and Yeast (make sure farm Yeast with the
sickle for much higher yield) while moving to the target location.</li><li>Make <code>Crafting Bench</code>.</li><li>Mine stone to make <code>Oxite Dissolver</code>, <code>Camp Fire</code> and <code>Stone Furnace</code> (2x)
(you can use the workshop furnace for one).<ol><li>Fill up the canister in the <code>Oxite Dissolver</code> with some Oxite and Sulfur.
Now you don't have to worry about Oxygen for a looong time.</li></ol></li><li>Make some antibiotics with <code>Charcoal</code> (from the campfire), Yeast and Silica.
These help reduce the duration of Pneumonia from the caves.</li><li>If I got some meat that can be dried up, I make a <code>Drying Rack</code>. This helps
give me three types of food for buffs. Berries for stamina (or cooked meat),
Cooked Prime Meat and Dried meat. Plus dried meat lasts for a much longer
time than cooked.</li><li>Mine 80 Iron Ore (this is usually more than two nodes) and smelt them in the
furnaces.</li><li>At 40 Iron, craft the <code>Anvil Bench</code>.<ol><li>Craft <code>Iron Pickaxe</code> if you do not have a workshop one.</li><li>Craft <code>Longbow</code> if you did not bring the workshop bow.</li><li>Craft <code>12 x 10</code> Iron nails for the <code>Machining Bench</code>.</li></ol></li><li>Farm enough <code>Fiber</code> (use the Sickle) to make 40 <code>Ropes</code> at the crafting bench.</li><li>Craft the <code>Mortar and Pestle</code> and put it on the bench. In it do:<ol><li>If you have the talent to convert wood to sticks (and be sure to take it).
Create 800 sticks (use <code>40</code> as the number in the crafting menu because each
wood creates 10 sticks). Put all the sticks in the Mortar and Pestle.</li><li>Craft 200 <code>Tree Saps</code>.</li><li>Craft 50 (or more) <code>Epoxy</code> as you can from Tree Saps (4) and Sulfur (2).</li></ol></li><li>Make the <code>Machining Bench</code>.</li><li>Craft the <code>Cement Mixer</code>.</li><li>Make 20 <code>Concrete Mix</code>: 20 Tree Sap, 160 Stone, 80 Silica.</li><li>Make <code>Concrete Furnace</code>.</li><li>Start melting <code>Gold Ore</code> for <code>Electronics</code>.</li><li>If you're going for the <code>Biofuel Generator</code>: Make 30 Concrete Mix.</li><li>If you did not bring the workshop biofuel can:<ol><li>Make <code>Biofuel Composter</code> and a <code>Biofuel Can</code>.</li><li>100 Tree Saps (that's 400 sticks) and 400 sticks can fill one can.

generally only need one for the generator.</li></ol></li><li>Mortal and Pestle:<ol><li>Craft 12 <code>Carbon Paste</code>. 8 for <code>Fabricator</code> and 4 for the<code>Electricity Tool</code>.</li></ol></li><li>Electronics:<ol><li>30 Electronics for the Fabricator.</li><li>12 for the Biofuel Generator.</li><li>5 electronics per Extractor.<ol><li>If going for Spirit, make 30 ish here which is more than enough.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>While mining, mine 60 <code>Platinum Ore</code>. We can use it to make a Platinum Axe
when the workshop one breaks. Or you can keep using the Iron Axe.</li><li>Make 21 steel. Make Steel Bloom from Iron Ore+Coal or Iron ingot+Ore in the
Mortar and Pestle and then cook in the Concrete Furnace.<ol><li>100 Steel Screws in the Machining Bench: 1 Steel.</li><li>Biofuel Generator: 20 Steel.</li></ol></li><li>Craft the Fabricator.</li><li>Craft the Biofuel Generator and Electricity Tool.</li><li>If going for Exotic farming, <strong>Do not craft Extractors</strong>.<ol><li>They go in the <code>Carry</code> slot which is where your workshop radar is.</li><li>We will take 5 Electronics and 20 Iron for each extractor.</li></ol></li><li>If you want to make stone buildings by the vein, make the <code>Masonry Bench</code>
(20 kg) and take 200 Iron Nails and Leather with you.<ol><li>We can deploy the bench at the destination and only need wood and stone
to craft the pieces. The bench is lighter than the items.</li><li>You don't need to make stone floors for the actual shelter floor.</li><li>If you're not worried about Snow, you can get away with using floor as roof. So make:<ol><li>4 Stone floor for roofs. 8 Stone walls.</li></ol></li><li>If you need proper roof for snow because snow will break floors as roof:<ol><li>8 Stone walls. 4 Stone wood/ramp. 4 Stone Wall Angled.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Before leaving the first tech up cave:<ol><li>Fill up the O2 canister again.</li><li>Grab as much food as you can.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 id=payday-extraction>Payday Extraction

usually run the mission on Easy because it only affects the payout (200 Ren) and
not the Exotic amount from the vein.</p><ol><li>Drop the workshop Radar on a ledge. This way the animals cannot reach the
radar. They will stop aggroing when the scans complete and you can pick them
off one-by-one.
<img src=02-payday1.jpg alt="Yeast and Radar location for PayDay Extraction"></li><li>Scan the area to see if the vein is in J14.</li><li>If the scan results contain both the veins in J11 and J14, it's almost always J14.<ol><li>If the result is J11 or I10, it's almost always very obvious.</li></ol></li><li>If it's not J14, go back to orbit and try again (don't forget the radar).</li><li>Kill the animals that came for the Radar. Make a bone sickle, harvest the
Yeast near the entry into the ledge (see the image above).</li><li>If J14, run to the star cave at K14. Mine Silica, Sulfur and Oxite on the way.</li><li>If you did not harvest Yeast, there's some by the South the lake in L11.

make 4 Stone floors and 8 Stone walls.</li><li>Make 4 Wood floors. This will be the base of the building. Complete it with
the Stone walls and use the Stone floors as roof.</li><li>I usually like to build right by the vein.</li><li>Drop the Biofuel Generator and Fabricator. I like to put it in the shelter
closest to the vein.</li><li>Put the Biofuel Workshop can in the generator.</li><li>Put the workshop Radar in the Fabricator. You can only carry the Extractors in the carry slot.</li><li>Create three Extractors and put them on the vein. This vein takes three
extractors (see icarusintel.com for info on other veins). Make sure you do
not drop them outside of the carry slot after dragging them from the
Fabricator inventory. They will get lost if it happens.</li><li>Use the Electricity Tool to make a junction (click on the ground outside the wall by the generator.<ol><li>Connect the junction to the generator.</li><li>Click on the junction with Electricity Tool again and connect it to each
of the extractors.</li><li>Select the Biofuel Generator and <code>Activate</code> it.</li></ol></li><li>Grab the workshop Radar from the Fabricator.</li><li>Deploy it on the ledge by the vein and activate it.</li><li>Wildlife might attack both the Radar and the Extractors.</li><li>This will scan the vein.

There are three veins. I run it on Easy
because there's no payout and difficulty does not affect the number of Exotics
in a vein. You can usually figure the general location by the first scan after
landing.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> With the introduction of <code>Orbital Exchange Interface</code>, you don't
have to haul the exotics back to the ship every time. You can call a pod an put
them there. But make sure to keep at least one exotic in your inventory if you
have the speed boost talent.</p><p>Also, you don't have to run all the way back to your pod anymore, you can either
make a <a href=https://icarus.fandom.com/wiki/Composite_Dropship_Recall_Beacon target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Composite Dropship Recall Beacon</a> or buy a cheap workshop
item to call the drop pod to your location. You can also put items in it and
call it around the map to move them.</p><ol><li>Drop the workshop Radar and scan. This will give you a general idea of where
the veins are.</li><li>If the vein in C4 is not active, I usually go away and reset the mission.</li><li>If the vein in C4 is active but I see the L12 and M14 veins active, I also go
away. They take a long time to run.</li><li>Go to the star cave in C3 to build up. The star cave in C2 is a backup for
bad RNG (e.g., not enough of a certain node like Gold).<ol><li>Another option is the star cave in E3 with three more backup caves.
