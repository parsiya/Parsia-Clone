the concept of "Needlepoints." These are locations in the OASIS that trigger
background music. Every page has at least 2-3 song references played at these
points.</p><p>Following the tradition, the new book also has a series of quests. The quests
are very simple. Most of them are handwaved with "I have already done a series
of activities on this planet and have this thingamajig that solves it." At least
3 of them where unnecessary.</p><h2 id=scalzi-john---the-dispatcher-01---the-dispatcher---45>Scalzi, John - The Dispatcher 01 - The Dispatcher - 4/5

horror stories, ranging from "ancient Gods waking up" to "mind-controlling

extrapolate how the aliens looked like and lived." Some were more adventurous
and followed the footsteps of extinct civilizations.</p><p>The only reason it got 4/5: The story by Orson Scott Card really felt out of
place in this anthology. It really didn't have anything to do with ancient
aliens remains or artifacts. I think they just wanted to include a story by a

ships in this story." If I want a sermon of how "military is the only thing

Most are side stories (or in between books) in the authors' established series.
E.g., David Weber's story happens before the Honorverse series. David Drake's
story is about Lt. Leary (RCN series). Lost Fleet story by Jack Campbell and so
on.</p><p>If you like this book, read the second volume, "Infinite Stars: Dark Frontiers."</p><p>The only stories that I skipped were "Imperium Imposter" and "A Taste of Ashes."</p><h2 id=williamson-michael-z---freehold-07---angeleyes---055>Williamson, Michael Z. - Freehold 07 - Angeleyes - 0.5/5

distaste for government. Williamson is a libertarian and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_%28novel%29 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Freehold</a>
was a libertarian utopia. I loved it and appreciated his worldview of "small
folks against big government." I didn't question how the big bad sluggish and
incompetent UN became so powerful. I guess this was before I realized I am more
of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Reynolds target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Mack Reynolds</a> type of "big gov hater."</p><p>Most people's problem with this book are the very detailed and graphic sex
scenes. It's a series of soft porn scenes interlaced with Sci-Fi. I also think
they were unnecessary, but hey, "sex sells."</p><p>I am not sure what has happened to the author since the original Freehold book
because he has turned into the online libertarian warrior caricature and a
walking Facebook meme page complaining about the new generation.</p><p>I laughed out loud halfway through the book when in the middle of the
interrogation, the torturer said "my preferred pronouns are xir." I didn't
expect a "pronouns in bio" moment and the main character ranting about trans
people. You wanna make a torturer trans, I have no problem with that, but "xir
is a torturer because xir is trans" was hilarious.</p><p>There were discussions about how minimum wage, employee benefits (Freehold
businesses went bankrupt because they had to provide benefits, lol), work hour
regulations (the torturers couldn't work more than 10 hours, lol), government
mandated contracts and even warnings on tools/appliances. What makes this more
hilarious is the author served 25 years in the US military which has all of
this and more. It's the biggest socialist jobs program in the country.</p><h2 id=anderson-kevin---saga-of-the-seven-suns-02---forest-of-stars---55>Anderson, Kevin - Saga of the Seven Suns 02 - Forest of Stars - 5/5

Martians, and other species mixed with AIs of different intelligence levels.</p><p>The universe offers digital existence, genetic modification, matter printers
(e.g., create almost any matter like food or clothes). Travel is still bound by
physical laws so going around the solar system is slow (and requires
hibernation). There are a few nearby stars that are populated (there's a mention
of ships at half the speed of light).</p><p>The story follows a group of characters (mainly a "robot AI" and a human) in

countless species of aliens. I give the world building 6/5 and main character

a fantasy tabletop game designer.</p><p>I especially liked how the author had devised a sort of distinctive grammar and
sentence structure in English for the each species' usage of the planet's
"common tongue" language. My favorite is the Itooti's usage of adjectives based
on the tone of the conversation. E.g., "Curious [Name] wants to know why flimsy
looking aliens [referring to humans] are in civilized [city name]."</p><p>Some cons: 2 of the 4 main humans are stock characters and they did not have a

If you don't know Weber, read
another book. He has good series like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Man target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Empire of Man</a> or his
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/470053 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Bolo</a> book.</p><p>If you're still inclined to read this book, read the prologue (chapter 0).
<strong>SKIP CHAPTERS 1 AND 2</strong>.</p><p>Chapter 1 is basically non-stop whining about how the American college is woke.
It's how high schoolers who've never been to college or old folks who were in
college decades ago, think it is. The professor is being silenced!</p><p>Chapter 2 is about shooting and how the professor is not a bigot because he has
a gay brother.</p><p>As another reviewer on Goodreads mentioned, you would expect chapter 3 to be
about quartering soldiers in homes or the 3rd amendment because that's how the
other two were.</p><p>I am not sure <strong>WHY</strong> I actually read these two chapters. I mean I expect
military science fiction is to be full of people on the conservative side of the
aisle, but this sort of nonsense was just too much. What made it worse was it
had almost nothing to do with the rest of the book. The book got better, but
that was mainly because this part was soooo bad.</p><h2 id=hartwell-david-g--weisman-jacob---the-sword--sorcery-anthology---45>Hartwell, David G. & Weisman, Jacob - The Sword & Sorcery Anthology - 4/5

<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Drake target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">David Drake</a> which is basically "the old British navy in space."
I liked the book and the setting because I am a fan of RCN (and David Drake).
The author has published a sequel, <a href=https://www.baen.com/the-silent-hand.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">The Silent Hand</a>. I will update
the booklist and this title when the series gets a name.</p><p>The setting is an honor-bound society (people duel when their "honor is taken")
ruled by an emperor. There are of course big families juggling for influence.
There are two types of citizens, demi-cits who are provided by the state and
vested citizens who can do what they want. There are ways to become a vested
citizen, but you face an uphill battle because influential families have the
backing of centuries and influence. There's an example of a new vested citizen
almost losing his life. Every military person is a vested citizen.
Officers can purchase their commissions (kinda). There are aliens (Shapers) who
visit every decade and exchange resources for tech. Ship-to-ship action is
mostly close range.</p><p>Saef, the main character is a male vested citizen from an old but poor
traditional family. Very similar to Daniel Leary in RCN who comes from a famous
family but is poor because he's estranged from his rich and famous father.</p><p>Inga Maru is a copy of Adele Mundy from RCN. The loyal but badass female
companion with exceptional abilities. The author has a short story named <code>Flops</code>
that deal with Inga's background. You can read it for free in
