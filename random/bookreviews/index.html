the concept of "Needlepoints." These are locations in the OASIS that trigger
background music. Every page has at least 2-3 song references played at these
points.</p><p>Following the tradition, the new book also has a series of quests. The quests
are very simple. Most of them are handwaved with "I have already done a series
of activities on this planet and have this thingamajig that solves it." At least
3 of them where unnecessary.</p><h2 id=scalzi-john---the-dispatcher---08-june-2023--0845---45>Scalzi, John - The Dispatcher - 08 June 2023 0845 - 4/5

and followed the footsteps of extinct civilizations.</p><p>The only reason it got 4/5: The story by Orson Scott Card really felt out of
place in this anthology. It really didn't have anything to do with ancient
aliens remains or artifacts. I think they just wanted to include a story by a

Most are side stories (or in between books) in the authors' established series.
E.g., David Weber's story happens before the Honorverse series. David Drake's
story is about Lt. Leary (RCN series). Lost Fleet story by Jack Campbell and so
on.</p><p>If you like this book, read the second volume, "Infinite Stars: Dark Frontiers."</p><p>The only stories that I skipped were "Imperium Imposter" and "A Taste of Ashes."</p><h2 id=williamson-michael-z---freehold-07---angleeyes---05-july-2023--0125---055>Williamson, Michael Z. - Freehold 07 - Angleeyes - 05 July 2023 0125 - 0.5/5

distaste for government. Williamson is a libertarian and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_%28novel%29 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Freehold</a>
was a libertarian utopia. I loved it and appreciated his worldview of "small
folks against big government." I didn't question how the big bad sluggish and
incompetent UN became so powerful. I guess this was before I realized I am more
of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Reynolds target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Mack Reynolds</a> type of "big gov hater."</p><p>Most people's problem with this book are the very detailed and graphic sex
scenes. It's a series of soft porn scenes interlaced with Sci-Fi. I also think
they were unnecessary, but hey, "sex sells."</p><p>I am not sure what has happened to the author since the original Freehold book
because he has turned into the online libertarian warrior caricature and a
walking Facebook memes complaining about the new generation.</p><p>I laughed out loud halfway through the book when in the middle of the
interrogation, the torturer said "my preferred pronouns are xir." I didn't
expect a "pronouns in bio" moment and the main character ranting about trans
people. You wanna make a torturer trans, I have no problem with that, but "xir
is a torturer because xir is trans" was hilarious.</p><p>There were discussions about how minimum wage, employee benefits (Freehold
businesses went bankrupt because they had to provide benefits, lol), work hour
regulations (the torturers couldn't work more than 10 hours, lol), government
mandated contracts and even warnings on tools/appliances. What makes this more
hilarious is the author served 25 years with the US military which has all of
this and more. It's the biggest socialist jobs program in the country.</p><h2 id=anderson-kevin---saga-of-the-seven-suns-02---forest-of-stars---15-july-2023--1220---55>Anderson, Kevin - Saga of the Seven Suns 02 - Forest of Stars - 15 July 2023 1220 - 5/5

"Murphy's Lawless" series. This book is a compilation of three novellas
"Infiltration" (Griffin Barber), "Insertion" (Chris Kennedy), and "Assault"
(Mike Massa) weaved together. Read the other books before starting this.</p><p>I deducted one star because this is not known beforehand. You're dropped in the
middle of a built universe without much explanation. Some of the concepts of the
book are explained through the book, but some questions are never answered.
Like, who are even the Harvesters?</p><p>There's a lot of text about character backgrounds and their relationships with
the original inhabitants of the system. These are never fully explored because
they're the subject of previous books in the series.</p><p>Other than that, the action is fluid and I liked the how book jumped between
the different locations and how everything came together for the final showdown.</p><h2 id=ringo-john---ghost---05>Ringo, John - Ghost - 0/5

The billion
worlds refer to the almost innumerable habitats, terraformed planets/moons, and
modified asteroids in the solar system (and a few nearby stars) housing
trillions of biological and digital beings. There are genetically modified
humans, dolphins, Martians, and other species mixed with AIs of different
intelligence levels.</p><p>The universe offers digital existence, genetic modification, matter printers
(e.g., create almost any matter like food or clothes). Travel is still bound by
physical laws so going around the solar system is slow (and required
hibernation). There are a few nearby stars that are populated (there's a mention
of ships being sent at around half of the speed of light).</p><p>The story follows a group of characters (mainly a "robot AI" and a human) in
search of a superweapon. I like the universe and Cambias' writing style.</p><h2 id=cambias-james-l---billion-worlds-02---the-scarab-mission---06-aug-2023--2234---55>Cambias, James L. - Billion Worlds 02 - The Scarab Mission - 06 Aug 2023 2234 - 5/5

countless species of aliens. I give the world building 6/5 and main character

sentence structure in English for the each species' usage of the planet's
"common tongue" language. My favorite is the Itooti's usage of adjectives based
on the tone of the conversation. E.g., "Curious [Name] wants to know why flimsy
looking aliens [refering to humans] are in civilized [city name]."</p><p>Some cons: 2 of the 4 main humans are stock characters and they did not have a
