the concept of "Needlepoints." These are locations in the OASIS that trigger
background music. Every page has at least 2-3 song references played at these
points.</p><p>Following the tradition, the new book also has a series of quests. The quests
are very simple. Most of them are handwaved with "I have already done a series

horror stories, ranging from "ancient Gods waking up" to "mind-controlling

extrapolate how the aliens looked like and lived." Some were more adventurous
and followed the footsteps of extinct civilizations.</p><p>The only reason it got 4/5: The story by Orson Scott Card really felt out of
place in this anthology. It really didn't have anything to do with ancient
aliens remains or artifacts. I think they just wanted to include a story by a
famous writer.</p><h2 id=ruocchio-christopher--daniel-tony---star-destroyers-anthology---355>Ruocchio, Christopher & Daniel, Tony - Star Destroyers (Anthology) - 3.5/5

ships in this story." If I want a sermon of how "military is the only thing

Most are side stories (or in between books) in the authors' established series.
E.g., David Weber's story happens before the Honorverse series. David Drake's
story is about Lt. Leary (RCN series). Lost Fleet story by Jack Campbell and so
on.</p><p>If you like this book, read the second volume, "Infinite Stars: Dark Frontiers."</p><p>The only stories that I skipped were "Imperium Imposter" and "A Taste of Ashes."</p><h2 id=williamson-michael-z---freehold-07---angleeyes---055>Williamson, Michael Z. - Freehold 07 - Angleeyes - 0.5/5

distaste for government. Williamson is a libertarian and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_%28novel%29 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Freehold</a>
was a libertarian utopia. I loved it and appreciated his worldview of "small
folks against big government." I didn't question how the big bad sluggish and
incompetent UN became so powerful. I guess this was before I realized I am more
of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Reynolds target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Mack Reynolds</a> type of "big gov hater."</p><p>Most people's problem with this book are the very detailed and graphic sex
scenes. It's a series of soft porn scenes interlaced with Sci-Fi. I also think
they were unnecessary, but hey, "sex sells."</p><p>I am not sure what has happened to the author since the original Freehold book
because he has turned into the online libertarian warrior caricature and a
walking Facebook meme page complaining about the new generation.</p><p>I laughed out loud halfway through the book when in the middle of the
interrogation, the torturer said "my preferred pronouns are xir." I didn't
expect a "pronouns in bio" moment and the main character ranting about trans
people. You wanna make a torturer trans, I have no problem with that, but "xir
is a torturer because xir is trans" was hilarious.</p><p>There were discussions about how minimum wage, employee benefits (Freehold
businesses went bankrupt because they had to provide benefits, lol), work hour
regulations (the torturers couldn't work more than 10 hours, lol), government
mandated contracts and even warnings on tools/appliances. What makes this more
hilarious is the author served 25 years in the US military which has all of
this and more. It's the biggest socialist jobs program in the country.</p><h2 id=anderson-kevin---saga-of-the-seven-suns-02---forest-of-stars---55>Anderson, Kevin - Saga of the Seven Suns 02 - Forest of Stars - 5/5

book are explained through the book, but some questions are never answered.

worlds refer to the almost innumerable habitats, terraformed planets/moons, and

trillions of biological and digital beings. There are genetically modified
humans, dolphins, Martians, and other species mixed with AIs of different
intelligence levels.</p><p>The universe offers digital existence, genetic modification, matter printers
(e.g., create almost any matter like food or clothes). Travel is still bound by
physical laws so going around the solar system is slow (and required
hibernation). There are a few nearby stars that are populated (there's a mention
of ships being sent at around half of the speed of light).</p><p>The story follows a group of characters (mainly a "robot AI" and a human) in
